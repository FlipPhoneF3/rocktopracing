## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep granite grey (#333333) reflects the rocky terrain and serious athletic endeavor of trail racing.
- Background color: A light grey (#F0F0F0) offers ample white space and lets the dark text stand out.
- Accent color: A deep red (#8B0000) complements the dark grey.
- Headline font: 'Metal Mania' sans-serif font is for titles and headers, fitting with the company logo and providing an immediate visual punch. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Emphasize large, high-quality images of trail running and scenic vistas. Content should breathe, with ample whitespace to highlight key information and maintain a minimalist, modern feel.
- Incorporate a few simple, consistent icons related to racing events (calendar, location, etc.)
- Subtle hover effects on event listings and registration buttons will enhance interactivity without overwhelming the user.
